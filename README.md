# HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition data to identify trends, risk factors, and key drivers influencing employee turnover. The dashboard is designed to support HR and leadership teams in making data-driven retention decisions.

Built as **Day 7 (Final Day) of my 7-Day Power BI Dashboard Challenge**.

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition impacts cost, productivity, and team stability.  
However, raw HR datasets make it difficult to understand:
- Which employee groups are most at risk
- How salary, satisfaction, and overtime influence attrition
- Whether tenure and promotion delays affect retention
- Which departments face higher attrition pressure

This dashboard consolidates these insights into a single analytical view.
